# Quad Serial 

Quad Serial is a project with four serial ports. The goal is to provide a way to get rid of that low quality USB - RS-232 cables by using a well know FT4232HL from FTDI.

# List of possibilities:
* 3 RS-232 COM port (2 of them ISOLATED + 1 non-isolated and shared with one UART)
* 2 Any level UARTs, you can use them anywhere from 1.8V to 5V
